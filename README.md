# Dad Jokes API

This API tells really good jokes. They're really good. Trust me. 

They're good.

## Setup

1) Open this repository in a codespace
2) Run `./bootstrap.sh` to setup your DB and build the project (`mvn clean install`)
3) In the top right of the IDE, click the play button with `Run Server` selected from the drop down next to it.
4) Open the `test-client.http` file in the root of the project and hit the play button.
5) Laugh uncontrollably. Or groan--groaning is better.

## TODO

This API is pri0 and we need your help. Here's what needs to get done:

- [ ] Create a devcontainer.json with a default VM size big enough for this project. Use your discretion. 
- [ ] Add an endpoint to POST a new Dad joke
